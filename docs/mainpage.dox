CIMUnit is a multi-threaded testing framework.  It assists developers in
testing multi-threaded applications by enforcing developer specified schedules.

CIMUnit uses the concepts of events and ensures that events are fired in a
specific sequence.  Developers insert into their test code statements to
define the allowable sequence of events, which is also knows as a schedule, and
statements indicating that a specific event has fired.

The CIMUnit framework detects when events fire and places threads to sleep or
wakes them up to ensure a specific event sequence is realized.  In its current
state, if it isn't possible for a specific sequence to be realized, a deadlock
may result and the test suite will hang.
